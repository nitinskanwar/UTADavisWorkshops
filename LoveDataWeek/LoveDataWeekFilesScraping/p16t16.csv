Lowest capacity represents the minimum capacity estimate submitted by the jurisdiction, while highest capacity represents the maximum capacity estimate. When a jurisdiction could only provide a single capacity estimate, it was used as both lowest and highest capacities.",,,,,,,,,,

c/State defines capacity differently than BJS. See Jurisdiction notes.,,,,,,,,,,
d/Private facilities included in capacity and custody counts.,,,,,,,,,,
