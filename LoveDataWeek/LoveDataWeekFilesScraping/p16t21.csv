"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Federal data include prisoners held in nonsecure, privately operated community corrections facilities and juveniles held in contract facilities. Estimates provided by state and federal departments of corrections’ administrative record systems and may not reflect prisoners’ self-identification of race or Hispanic origin. State, federal, and national totals by race and Hispanic origin differ from other tables in this report due to adjustments made by BJS to correct for differences between administrative records and prisoner self-reported data of race and Hispanic origin.",,,,,,,,,,,,
~Not applicable. State does not track this race or Hispanic origin.,,,,,,,,,,,,
/Not reported.,,,,,,,,,,,,
a/Excludes persons of Hispanic or Latino origin.,,,,,,,,,,,,
b/The Federal Bureau of Prisoners includes persons of Hispanic origin in the individual racial categories when reporting to NPS. BJS used data from 2016 FJSP (preliminary) to disaggregate race and Hispanic origin.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c/Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Other Pacific Islanders combined in a single category and reported as Asian.",,,,,,,,,,,,
d/Counts from 2016 are not comparable to counts from prior years due to a change in reporting methodology. See Jurisdiction notes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
e/Number of persons of Hispanic origin may be undercounted due to ongoing changes in information systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,
f/Prisoners of Hispanic origin are included in the individual racial categories.,,,,,,,,,,,,
g/State did not submit 2016 NPS data on race or Hispanic origin. Counts were imputed. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,
