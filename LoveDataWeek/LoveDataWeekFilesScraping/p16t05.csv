"c/Excludes persons of Hispanic or Latino origin, unless noted.",,,,,,,,,,
"d/Total number of sentenced state prisoners for the 2016 SPI is based on the 2015 NPS because the NPS reference date of December 31, 2015, is closer to the start of the 2016 SPI fielding (January 2016). Because prisoners held in local jails were not sampled in the 2016 SPI, these totals exclude those prisoners and differ from the 2015 sentenced jurisdiction counts presented in tables 3 and 4.",,,,,,,,,,
